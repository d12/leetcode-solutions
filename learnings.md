### General

### Cycles

Tortise and the hare / fast-slow algorithm (Floyd's cycle finding algorithm) can solve lots of cycle problems.

### Majority

Boyer-Moore voting algorithm is handy for majority questions https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyer%E2%80%93Moore_majority_vote_algorithm

### O(1) space

An O(1) space requirement means no trees, graphs, linked lists, queues or stacks, unless they're bounded in size by some constant. It also means no recursion that's bounded by the input size or the log of the input size.
